First generation hatchery-bred juvenile Atlantic salmon originating from the River Imsa stock (58?ø54=N, 5?ø57=E) were held at Ims Research Station (Norwegian Institute for Nature Research), Norway, for 31 weeks (29 September 2010 ƒ?? 2 May 2011) in 1 m [square] tanks under three different rearing conditions (Fig. 1): (i) standard barren hatchery environment versus enrichment via the addition of (ii) plastic tubes (length = 10ƒ??20 cm; diameter = 4 cm) or (iii) shredded black plastic bags (length = 60 cm).

When examining basal levels of cortisol, six ‹ªsh from each replicate tank were netted simultaneously. Any enrichment structures were quickly lifted out of the water while the ‹ªsh were netted.

First, by treating the first year of growth of Kuskokwim River chum salmon as a ""counterfactual"" (i.e., little to no competition with Asian pink and chum salmon), we were better able to assess the possibility that spurious statistical associations between growth and Asian pink and chum salmon abundance indices arose from coinciding time series, which can confound inferences about causal effects of competition (e.g., Cunningham et al., 2018). Second, the sharp decline in Japanese hatchery chum salmon beginning with the 2011 earthquake provided a way to test for density dependence in the Bering Sea against a backdrop of limited contrast in hatchery releases of chum salmon over the previous three decades (NPAFC, 2020), which has hampered efforts to understand the competitive effects of hatchery chum salmon","First, we predicted that competition should manifest in reduced growth of Kuskokwim River chum salmon from the second year of growth at sea onwards, but not during the first year of growth at sea when these populations would have minimal overlap with Asian populations (Agler et al., 2013). Second, we examined growth of chum salmon in the Bering Sea in relation to reduced abundance of Japanese chum salmon associated with the Thoku earthquake and tsunami of 2011. This disaster destroyed a number of hatcheries along the Pacific coast, reducing the numbers and subsequent survival of hatchery chum salmon released that spring (Watanabe et al., 2015).
